# Adam-Optimiser-Project
You can find the code for algorithms in Optimisation_Algorithms folder.
It consists of the following three algorithms
1. Adagrad
2. Rmsprop
3. Adam optimiser

Inorder to run the above algorithms,you need scilab software.
(here is the link to download scilab for various platforms http://www.scilab.org/en/download/latest)

After downloading the scilab you just need to copy and paste the code provided.

Replace the 'f' variable in the code with the function for which you want to find the minima.

Replace the 'g' variable in the code with the gradient of the function for which you want to find the minima.

In case of Adagrad only change the variable 'dim' with the no. of dimensions of domain.

The output of all the programs are the minima of the function and the no. of iterations in which the algorithm
is computing the minima.

You can see the results that we computed previously inorder to compare the algorithms, by taking some famous functions in "Report.pdf".
